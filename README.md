## Summary
This repository contains the code related to the project on 'Museum Painting Retrieval' of the Module 1: Introduction to Human and Computer Vision of the Master in Computer Vision at UAB. 

The aim of this master module is to implement a query by example CBIR system for finding paintings in a museum image collection using color, texture, text and feature descriptors in datasets with different perturbations in the images: noise, overlapping text boxes, color corruption and rotation.

The module consists of 5 different deliveries that build up to a complete pipeline.
